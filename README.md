# Css Html Coding Kata 

This is my coding-kata perspective on Css and Html course I took recently on udemy [Build modern responsive websites & UIs with HTML5, CSS3 & Sass! Learn Flex & CSS Grid by Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/). In Coding-Kata you have a number tasks, and you practice on each repetitively until achieve masterly. This is better done using criteria to measure oneself against, this could using time-blocking and/or some other quality metric like automated tests or peer review. I will keep my Kata simple, I will privide a brief texual and mage description of a task and rough time limit. I will recommend for you to first try the Kata on you own before you look at my codepen solution. More importantly repeat each task until you are comfortable in terms of time and performance, do it as many times as you can, try it every day if necessary. This how you can achieve happiness and masterly
